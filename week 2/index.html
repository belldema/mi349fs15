    <p>My project will be a portfolio and a scheduling website for my hair grooming business. It will allow potential clients to see some of the best work that I have done. It will also include advertisements for other things that I am trying to sell such as food and snacks. It will also provide a list of services that I provide and the prices that I charge for them. Lastly, it will provide a schedule for me that includes the times and days that I am free. </p>
